	<h2>A little about me</h2>



<p>My name is Teagan Wrest, and I'm currently beginning the Galvanize Full Stack program. People find me to be an upbeat, self-motivated team player with excellent problem solving skills. I have received a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Central Washington University and for the past five months I have worked at C & D Zodiac as a Composite Structural Engineer.  In the last couple years I have been bitten hard by the white water rafting bug and have been lucky enough to live in the Pacific Northwest where I can do it almost year round. I'am also very passionate about tennis, gardening and woodworking. Most important of all is that I have recently found a true passion for coding and with that I have started learning the basics of coding, trying out tutorials, and looking at open source software. I look forward to this new passion, and the places it can take me.</p>
